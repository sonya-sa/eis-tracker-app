EIStracker App
===
EIStracker is a web application designed to better inform the public of Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) open for public commenting across the United States. It was created with the intention of generating awareness through the use of social media at the early stages of environmental reviews . The Google Maps API was used to display projects happening in each state, with project documents easily accessible for download upon a click. Users can tweet preloaded project details or generated a Facebook message with a link to the EPA’s EIS Database in order to raise awareness. A Twitter timeline displays the user’s tweets along with others using the same hashtag. All data was obtained from the EPA’s EIS Database via scraping.
